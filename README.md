Executive Overview
<br>
Tradeblock is an eCommerce platform in which users can barter with each other in order to trade pairs of sneakers. Given the niche market that is geographically widespread, this app helps to collect shoe enthusiasts and collectors alike, giving them a community where they can trade and discuss various sneakers. As a newly started business Tradeblock currently does not have an internal trade valuation system, where they are able to determine the value of a trade as compared to market value or use a system to determine how likely a potential proposed trade is to be accepted. A current issue that the app is facing is the low acceptance rates of proposed trades. By our estimates, less than 2% of all proposed trades are being declined or countered. This leads to a negative user experience, in which one has to work increasingly hard to find a user that will accept your barter. Tradeblock aims to capture various predictors in order to be able to better suggest trades to users, increasing both the percentage of accepted trades and therefore the customer trade experience. Our group will provide Tradeblock with multiple models capturing this relationship as well as a study on the various indicators that are most important in predicting the status of a trade.
In the following report our group of analysts dives into the various factors captured within the trade profile in order to better understand how to best analyze and predict a future trade based on indicators. We also seek to understand the dollar disparity between trades, and how an extra dollar would affect the likelihood of a trade being accepted. These recommendations would greatly benefit the Tradeblock organizationâ€™s understanding of the users implicit trading habits and would prove beneficial in implementing suggestions and promotions alike.
